**Lead Software Engineer | Backend & Distributed Systems**  
Java • Spring Boot • Microservices • Kubernetes • JVM Performance

I design and build reliable, scalable backend systems with a strong focus on **performance, observability, and maintainability**.  
Currently leading the development of **business-critical CRM microservices** at **Check24 (Kredit), Germany**, operating in high-traffic production environments.

- **Production-grade microservices** and service integration
- **Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD** in daily operations
- Messaging and asynchronous systems (**ActiveMQ, JMS**)
- Data stores: **Oracle, MySQL/Percona, Elasticsearch**
- **JVM performance**: memory, GC, threading, production debugging
- Pragmatic architecture, code quality, and long-term ownership

## Selected Repositories

These repositories reflect patterns and approaches I use in real-world systems:

- **Spring Backend Utilities**  
  Production-oriented Spring Boot examples (REST APIs, configuration, resilience, observability)
